# Wow loop for Codex

Improve one deliverable against a concrete quality contract through independent review
and repair. Take the target from the invocation or conversation. Explicit invocation
enables this workflow even for a small artifact. Discussing or editing the skill does not.

Maintain this native Codex skill directly. Arena explores competing approaches; lab
supports human tuning. Neither is required. This workflow owns its resume state without
nesting another orchestration skill.

## 1. Preflight

Inspect the artifact, project requirements, current edits, and exposed tools. Preserve
the requested starting state. Isolate concurrent work when needed; give concurrent servers
separate ports and build directories. Confirm the preview serves the intended checkout.

Independent review requires separate agents. Spawn subagents with `fork_turns: "none"`
and self-contained briefs by default. Critics always start fresh. Use native subagents,
not new sidebar tasks. Keep model settings inherited unless the user directs otherwise.
If independent context or a required evidence tool is unavailable, record the affected
check as unavailable and continue useful work without claiming that gate passed.

For visual work, read [visual review](references/visual-review.md), take one real capture
or render, and inspect it before dispatching review rounds. Establish named states and
capture conditions, with fixed seeds where needed and tolerances for rendering variation.
Interactive and animated work also needs a natural run.

## 2. Set the bar

Gather current facts, constraints, baseline evidence, and usable references. Delegate
read-only recon when scope warrants it. One director produces a coherent spec and
`bar.md`; leave implementation judgment within explicit constraints.

Start with 5-10 top-level criteria, expanding only to cover real requirements. Give each
check a stable ID, scope, reference or rationale, state/view, method, pass condition,
tolerance, and acceptance impact. Keep fidelity, visual appeal, function, and performance
distinct. For example, a reference may support "headline is 5x body size at the target
viewport"; "feels premium" gives a critic no checkable condition.

Use exact reference captures or excerpts when available. Without a suitable reference,
derive checks from the user's goal and disclose the comparison limit. Concrete visual
judgment is valid: identify the composition, silhouette, hierarchy, material, or motion
being compared rather than forcing every observation into a number.

Split into modules only when independently reviewable parts help. Record dependencies,
local checks, and whole-deliverable checks. Future integration checks remain pending;
they do not block unrelated local progress.

Fix acceptance before implementation. User feedback becomes a versioned amendment with
named checks and affected scope. Clarify ambiguity without weakening the user's bar.

## 3. Checkpoint and resume

Read [state and resume](references/state.md). Before implementation, create
`.tmp/wow-loop/<task-slug>/state.json`, with the spec, bar, and evidence beside it.
The orchestrator alone writes state. Save before dispatch, after implementation and
review, and before yielding. Agents write reports and captures to assigned paths.

Resume by reconciling actual content, evidence, contract amendments, and active workers.
Invalidate affected passes and dependent checks after changes; retain unrelated verified
progress. Select the next ready scope by blockers, severity, and dependencies. Resume
never resets the budget or silently restarts the artifact.

Default budget: 12 implementation-and-review rounds across the entire run, including
initial attempts and repairs after final review. Reserve a round before dispatching its
writer. Interrupted or failed attempts still count; review-only passes do not. Track
critic retries separately and change the evidence method after two consecutive identical
review failures. Honor explicit user limits in place of the default. Exhaustion prevents
new implementation attempts; finish the current review and required read-only acceptance
checks. If further implementation is needed, checkpoint as budget_exhausted and request
a raised budget. Explicit user limits on time or review work still apply.

## 4. Implement and review

Use one implementation writer at a time. Its brief contains the target, current contract,
relevant findings, allowed paths, dependencies, local checks, and applicable browser
requirements. The writer inspects its own captures and runs local checks before returning
changed paths, evidence, and known limits. Stop writes before reviewing that artifact.

Assign separate read-only experience and engineering critics. Adapt engineering checks
to the artifact, such as export integrity for a document. Respect exposed concurrency;
serialize browser control or performance measurements that share resources.

Give critics the contract, references, baseline, artifact paths, permitted tools, and
capture conditions. Exclude builder explanations and previous verdicts from initial
assessment. Critics collect their own captures and run relevant checks. They can write
evidence but cannot edit the deliverable or orchestrator state.

Each critic returns the inspected content/contract versions, per-check passed/failed/
unavailable results, evidence paths, and findings with stable IDs, severity, acceptance
impact, and a concrete observed defect. Record missing coverage and uncertainty.
After initial assessment, reconcile previous findings explicitly; silence does not close
an earlier defect. Measure disputed claims when possible.

## 5. Repair

Resolve findings against the contract and evidence, recording reasons for disputed
verdicts. Send ranked confirmed findings to the sole writer. Reproduce defects where
possible and verify repairs under the same conditions. A nonreproducible defect stays
unresolved until evidence supports closure.

Rerun failed and affected checks, preserving unrelated valid passes. After the same check
fails twice, record the cause and change approach. After four repair rounds on one module,
reassess strategy and decomposition within the remaining total budget. Never lower the
bar or repeat identical attempts merely to obtain approval.

## 6. Review the whole

After local acceptance, assign a fresh experience critic the complete deliverable and
whole-deliverable contract. Inspect integration, composition, transitions, and the full
intended experience. Run applicable integration checks on the same content version.

When comparative visual quality is part of the goal and matched evidence is available,
use two fresh judges. Give them captures or clips labeled only A and B, shuffle order
independently, and keep provenance and the label mapping out of their briefs. Require
a preference or tie with visible reasons tied to criteria. Record recognizable references
that limit blinding. Follow the comparison conditions in the visual review reference.

Resolve disagreement through cited evidence and requirements. Preference votes cannot
establish fidelity or correctness. Record residual taste differences without inventing
a threshold after results arrive or rerunning judges to obtain favorable votes.

## 7. Accept or hand off

The orchestrator reads final reports and key renders, verifies evidence matches the
integrated artifact, and runs remaining required checks or rechecks invalidated results.
Clean up task-owned processes when their work is finished.

Mark `passed` only when every mandatory local and whole check has current passing
evidence, required independent reviews are complete, and no acceptance-blocking finding
remains. Nonblocking suggestions may remain only if they contradict no required check.

Otherwise record `in_progress`, `blocked`, or `budget_exhausted`, with the exact cause
and next action. Failed, unavailable, and stale required checks prevent acceptance.
Report what changed, verification, residuals, and the absolute state path. A checkpoint
supports later resume after context reset; it schedules nothing. Use a verified runtime
scheduling capability only when the user requests scheduling.

## Anti-patterns

- Do not replace independent review with self-review or visual inspection with code reading.
- Do not accept builder claims or captures that the reviewer did not inspect.
- Do not trust one angle, one animation frame, or modules without whole-deliverable review.
- Do not attach a passing verdict to changed content or missing evidence.
- Do not filter away findings through mismatched severity labels.
- Do not use numeric quality scores or preference votes as acceptance gates.
- Do not weaken criteria, reset attempts on resume, or call budget exhaustion a pass.
