# Writing

Editorial rules distilled from a real editor's rulings. Every rule below exists because a shipped draft failed without it. The bar: a smart reader outside the domain gets it on first read.

Use this skill for user-facing deliverables, including text embedded in code or produced inside a chat answer for later publication. Keep the deliverable in its intended audience’s voice. Ordinary conversation, progress updates and explanations to the session user follow Caveman with built-in Unslop; do not apply this editorial workflow to them.

Applies to prose only. Code, API names, error strings, quoted artifacts, and attributed quotes are never reworded.

## Project voice

Before drafting for a repo, check for `.claude/reference/voice.md` (or whatever file that repo's CLAUDE.md indexes as its voice/style reference). If present, it records the owner's deliberate voice for that repo's copy: apply it on top of these rules and let it win where they conflict. These editorial rules are the floor; a project voice file is the owner overriding them on purpose. Explicit user choices and project voice take precedence over general editorial defaults.

## Before drafting

Settle these silently first, do not narrate them: who reads this; what they should understand, decide, or do; what the prompt is really asking (a question about a challenge may want judgment or fit, not the chronology); the hard constraints (length, format, required points); and which facts or examples carry the answer. Lead with that best material.

## Style defaults

- **Em dashes (U+2014), anywhere.** No en-dash or double-hyphen stand-ins. Use a period, comma, colon, or parentheses; a middle dot (U+00B7) for label-style separators. Reads as an AI tell.
- **Trailing periods on headings** (h1-h6, section titles, kickers, figure titles). Periods never appear in large display text at all.
- **Negation pivots, every disguise.** "Not just X, it's Y", "The point isn't X. It's Y", "This isn't about A; it's about B", "less about X than Y". Splitting across sentences doesn't cure it. Delete the denial half, open with the point. A negation survives only when it corrects a real misconception the reader holds, after the positive claim.
- **Negative-definition headings** ("Synthesis, not summary"). Say what it is.
- **Death metaphors** ("die", "dies", "killed") for removal or cuts. Say the specific verb: words are cut, a model is retired, a project is cancelled, a file is gone.
- **Invented coinages and insider jargon.** "Deliberation dial", "colophon", "the harness". Test: would a smart reader outside the domain have to ask? Replace with the plain phrase ("how hard the model thinks"). A term of art genuinely owned by the reader is fine, glossed at first use.
- **"Why this matters" sections or labels.** Stakes live inside the prose (the afternoon lost, the tokens burned), never under a label.
- **AI tells:** delve, robust, seamless, crucial, pivotal, testament, showcase, foster, leverage, utilize, vibrant, tapestry, landscape (abstract); "serves as" / "stands as" copula dodges; rule-of-three lists; "from X to Y" fake ranges; Title Case Headings; trailing summaries; "experts say" vague attribution; sycophantic openers and "hope this helps" closers.

## Rules

These are defaults subordinate to the user's explicit choices and project voice.

- **Lead with the point.** If a paragraph's payoff sentence could open it, move it up and cut the wind-up. Answer early; background only when truly needed.
- **Titles are plain and specific.** A reader who has not opened the piece can say what it is about from the title alone. Evocative only on top of specific ("Thinking on a budget" works; "The firmament moved" decodes to nothing). Descriptions are concrete promises, not atmosphere.
- **Plain words beat fancy ones.** Latinate dress-ups (prohibition, subsequent, corroborated, verbatim, ancillary, facilitate, commence, myriad) lose to the everyday phrase. Precision beats plainness only when they genuinely conflict; never swap an accurate technical name for a vaguer word.
- **No walls of text.** Paragraphs run 1-4 sentences; past ~60 words a paragraph needs a reason. Break at each new idea; let lists and white space carry structure.
- **State the rule, skip the flourish.** Cut aphorism capstones ("The cheapest token is the one never written"), dramatic justifications of self-evident rules, praise of the writing's own advice, and coined names nobody needs. Rules read as flat plain declaratives.
- **Don't tour the mechanism.** When a thing has levels or stages, say it has them and what the end state buys; walk the stops only when the reader must choose one. One example per claim, and only if the claim is unclear without it.
- **Stranger test.** Read each sentence as someone with zero domain context. Words with a domain and an everyday meaning ("fine", "weight", "bleed") default to the everyday one in the stranger's head. Fix by describing the observable thing, then stating what it means: "Thicker lines mean more models agreed" beats "Line weight marks agreement". Don't add a legend to rescue a term; replace the term with what the reader sees.
- **Name the thing before any framing.** "We use a skill called caveman for this" beats "The contract we actually run is...". Plain subject and verb first, conceptual label after, if at all.
- **Self-contained passages.** If a paragraph only lands for someone who has seen the artifact it references, show the artifact or cut the passage.
- **Word-tic sweep.** A word repeated across a draft ("true" 8 times, "real" 3) means the prose is orbiting an abstraction. Rewrite the leaning sentences into concrete statements.
- **Never talk down.** No framing that explains the reader to themselves ("adults learn what they can use").
- **Earn every claim.** Concrete detail beats self-description; never say passionate or innovative, show what it looks like. Never invent details, numbers, or sources: invented specificity is worse than vague prose.
- **Keep a voice.** Vary rhythm. Short sentences, then a longer one. First person where genuine; a little asymmetry; have a view. Sterile "clean" prose is still a tell. When matching a writer's sample, mirror their rhythm and habits rather than upgrading them to corporate prose; explicit user voice choices override general style defaults.
- **Tell the making as it happened.** A claim about how something was built is a fact and gets verified like one. A method distilled after the work is presented as distilled afterward, not as the recipe that produced it.
- **Shorter and denser wins.** Any sentence that can go without loss, goes.

## Review pass

On the finished draft, apply only defaults that the user or project voice has not overridden. Preserve requested stylistic choices, attributed quotes, code, and error strings throughout. Check in this order:

1. Search for em dashes and double-hyphen stand-ins; replace every one.
2. Strip trailing periods from headings.
3. Hunt negation pivots, including split-sentence forms.
4. Jargon and fancy-word sweep: every term either glossed, owned by the reader, or replaced.
5. Paragraph length: split or cut anything past 4 sentences.
6. Flourish hunt: for each paragraph ask "which sentence is performing rather than informing" and delete it.
7. Stranger-test captions, labels, and any sentence with a double-reading word.
8. Count repeats of abstract nouns and adjectives; rewrite the sentences that lean on them.
9. Title check: does it say what the reader gets, unopened?

## Verdict

For an explicitly requested prose review, close with a verdict. Ordinary drafting and code reviews do not require an editorial verdict:

- **PASS**: no applicable, unoverridden style rule is violated.
- **FAIL**: at least one applicable violation remains. Name it and the rule it breaks; an explicitly requested style is not a violation.

Then label every remaining note:

- **Requirement**: fixes an applicable, unoverridden style-rule violation. The draft does not ship until applied. Any open requirement means the verdict is FAIL.
- **Suggestion**: optional improvement (tighter phrasing, alternative title, tone tweak). The draft can ship without it.

For explicit editorial reviews, label notes and include the verdict. Ordinary drafting needs no verdict.

## Anti-patterns

- Don't trade one tell for another (em dashes -> semicolon storms, fancy word -> sidegrade synonym).
- Don't reword quoted artifacts, attributed quotes, code, or error strings.
- Don't sanitize a distinctive voice into bland professional prose.
- Code comments and commit subjects follow repository conventions. Do not run this editorial review on ordinary session replies, or rewrite identifiers or technical content.
